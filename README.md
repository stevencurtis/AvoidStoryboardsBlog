I've written an article [article](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/write-clean-code-by-overriding-loadview-ac4f172163d0) spelling out the advantages of using loadView() instead of using Storyboards. This is great, and people appreciate the artilce. 

The problem? The article works with Playgrounds and a Single View Application in Xcode assumes that you are going to use a Storyboard, and deleting it gives an error. What a mistake.

To get rid of those annoying storyboards, read on.

Difficulty: Beginner | **Easy** | Normal | Challenging
This article has been developed using Xcode 11.4.1, and Swift 5.2.2

## Prerequisites: 
* This article has been written to allow you to write code using loadView() like in my [article](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/write-clean-code-by-overriding-loadview-ac4f172163d0) featuring Playgrounds. You will be expected to be aware how to make a [Single View Application](https://medium.com/swlh/your-first-ios-application-using-xcode-9983cf6efb71) in Swift.

## Terminology
Storyboards: A visual representation of the User Interface of an Application

## The challenge
Once you have created a [Single View Application](https://medium.com/swlh/your-first-ios-application-using-xcode-9983cf6efb71) you are presented with something like the following image:

What's the problem? Can you see on the left hand side? Beside the *projects*? We have a Storyboard there - and the whole point is we aren't going to be using it. If we delete it, we won't get any further than a blank screen on the Simulator followed by an **NSInvalidArgumentException**. That's not great at all.

# The step-by-step

I'm going to arrange my classes much like the [loadview article](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/write-clean-code-by-overriding-loadview-ac4f172163d0)


## The classes
I can list the code for these classes (now I prefer to download these from the [Repo](https://github.com/stevencurtis/AvoidStoryboardsBlog) but there you go), but I'm leaving the explaination with the original article [loadview article](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/write-clean-code-by-overriding-loadview-ac4f172163d0)
