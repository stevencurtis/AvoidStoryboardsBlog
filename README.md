This article has been developed using Xcode 11.4.1, and Swift 5.2.2

## Prerequisites: 
* This article has been written to allow you to write code using loadView() like in my [article](https://medium.com/@stevenpcurtis.sc/write-clean-code-by-overriding-loadview-ac4f172163d0) featuring Playgrounds. You will be expected to be aware how to make a [Single View Application] (https://medium.com/swlh/your-first-ios-application-using-xcode-9983cf6efb71) in Swift.
